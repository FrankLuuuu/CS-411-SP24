## Project Summary

In this project we want to use a recipe dataset to help users to find a meal recipe that utilizes the ingredients that they have on hand. If they are missing any ingredients from the recipe, a list of nearby grocery stores will be generated for them to choose where to get the necessary ingredients. We will also have other features like cuisine generation and meal plan storage to help the user select and manage the meals that they want.
